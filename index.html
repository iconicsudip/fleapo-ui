                    <p class="bold">Cryptocurrency adoption is at less than 1% of the global world population with some
                        countries and entities actively
                        fighting against its mass adoption and the smartest developers and nerds holding the fort.</p>
                    <p>Bitcoin was the first, and it has since grown to thousands of tokens launched all aiming to fix
                        one
                        problem or the other
                        with some quite simply FOMOing the moment. Our goal is to bring mass adoption to the
                        cryptocurrency
                        space by dumbing it
                        down. How far down? So down that even a celebrity can explain it in simple words to their
                        followers
                        and have them
                        download an app, buy into the social currency of their favourite person and watch their
                        investment as is with other crypto currency project.</p>
                    <p>We are trying to do to this space what investment apps did for the "nonexistent retail
                        investors". We
                        are gamefying
                        digital currency, bringing in popular faces instead of hard to understand projects to make it
                        the
                        norm and inadvertently
                        being the "gateway drug" for a lot of people to finally give this space a real look.</p>
                    <p class="bold">
                        A new digital economy is coming. People would be just as powerful as countries and creators
                        would be
                        paid beyond the
                        peanuts that conventional social media platforms can offer.

                    <p>
                        There would be new markets and advertisers with little to offer would not find home there. Like
                        Kanye said,
